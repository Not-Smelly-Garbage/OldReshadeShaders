# OldShaders
Some old reshade shaders from before they got removed from the repos
These include
AmbientLight.fx, the old CrossHair.fx, MagicBloom.fx, Matcap.fx, MotionBlur.fx, NightVision.fx (just a filter), Posterize.fx
PPFX_Bloob.fx, PPFX_Godrays.fx, PPFX_SSDO.fx, ReflectiveBumpMapping.fx, Retro_Neon.fx (Tron effect {from gshade}), RetroCRT.fx (not really CRT-ey but looks neat), SSAO.fx (bunch of random screen space ambient occulsion effects) and xhair.fx

Some of these are not from the original repo, some are from GShade and xhair is from a completely different repo, but i thought it'd be neat to add. Some might not be old (MagicBloom?) but I have it saved anyway.

All shaders are created by their owners, I did not make any of these, just distributing them. You can get GShade here:

And Xhair here :
